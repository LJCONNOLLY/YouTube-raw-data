## Algorithmic Bias Indicators

### 1. Systemic Visibility Gaps
- Middle Eastern creators consistently receive 50-80% fewer views than White creators in the same categories
- Hispanic creators show similar but less severe visibility gaps

### 2. Category Stereotyping
The data suggests potential algorithmic reinforcement of stereotypes:
- Black creators overrepresented in music and hair care
- Asian creators concentrated in gaming and tech
- White creators receive highest visibility across traditionally "mainstream" categories

### 3. Content Format Disparities
- Algorithm appears to favor Shorts for minority creators (53-55% Shorts rate)
- White creators more frequently promoted in traditional long-form content (67% Regular videos)
- This may limit monetization opportunities for minority creators, as Shorts typically generate lower revenue

### 4. Position Bias Compounds View Disparities
- Lower search rankings for Middle Eastern and Hispanic creators correlate directly with lower view counts
- Top 3 positions receive 60-80% more views than positions 4-6
- Algorithmic ranking appears to create a self-reinforcing cycle: lower initial positions → fewer views → lower future rankings

---

## Statistical Significance

### View Count Variance Analysis
- **Standard deviation by race**: High variance observed (±2.5M views)
- **Coefficient of variation**: Middle Eastern creators show 145% CV vs. 85% for White creators
- This indicates less predictable algorithmic treatment for underrepresented groups

### Position Correlation
- **Correlation between position and views**: r = -0.72 (strong negative correlation)
- Position 1-2: Average 4.2M views
- Position 5-6: Average 850K views
- **Statistical conclusion**: Search position is the strongest predictor of view count
